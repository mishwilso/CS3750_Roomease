## Groceries functionality
There are new custom images to represent different categories of foods. 
When you add a grocery (by hitting the + button) you can select one of the categories and it will put a gray box around the one that is selected. After hitting done, you will be able to see the image in front of the grocery in the grocery list.
Navigation was also updated so hitting done will bring you back to the previous page.

You are also able to swipe delete a grocery from the list. This will put the grocery in the 'groceries already bought list' and cross it out. You can either delete it from this list by hitting the trashcan, or swipe right to add it back to the 'groceries to purchase' list.
