## Chores functionality
You are now able to create a custom room and add chores to it. 
You can do this by selecting the 'create custom room' button at the end of the list of other rooms. 
After hitting done, you will be taken back to the list of all rooms and you can scroll to see your new room!

Navigation was also updated so that when you add a room or a chore and press 'Done', you will be brought back to the previous page.
